 # Hi, Call me Cencia if you want to; my name is Maduleme Vinicencia Chinuruolum.

I'm on a mission to master data analysis and have a passion for turning facts into insights. About myself, a little bit:

I enjoy delving into intricate information, spotting obscure patterns, and crafting tales that are informed by data.
- I'm now studying advanced SQL, Excel, and Tableau, as well as data visualization approaches.
- I'm interested in working with you on projects involving data analysis, machine learning, or other fascinating data-related problems.
- ðŸ“« My email address is vmaduleme@gmail.com, and you can find me on LinkedIn at (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinicencia-maduleme-443791178).

Please feel free to browse my GitHub repositories, where I post the code for my data analysis projects. Join me as we set off on this data trip!
